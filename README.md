# TIC TAC TOE - DOM Manipulation

1. Get all the cells in the game board and store them in a variable.
2. Create a function to manipulate the game board when a player clicks on a cell(the eventlistener should be attached for every cell - hint: use loops and classList).
3. In the created function, check if the cell is already occupied by another player.
4. Associate a unique CSS class to each player and use it to mark the cells they occupy.
5. Create a function to check the game state after each move and declare a winner or a tie.
6. Create a function to display the end game message (winner or tie) in a display element, such as a div with a specific ID.
7. Add a reset button to allow players to start a new game.
8. Ensure the game can be played by two different players, so they can make alternate moves.
9. Allow players to select a unique symbol to represent each player (e.g., X and O).
